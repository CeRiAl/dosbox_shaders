# DosBox Shaders

A collection of shaders for [Dugan's DosBox Fork](https://github.com/duganchen/dosbox/blob/master/ENHANCEMENTS.md).

I've ported these from from shaders in the following repositories:

* [common-shaders](https://github.com/libretro/common-shaders)
* [interpolation-shaders](https://github.com/aliaspider/interpolation-shaders)
* [quark-shader](https://github.com/hizzlekizzle/quark-shaders)

Each shader is licensed under the same terms as the one it was ported from.
